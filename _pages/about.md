Hey there!
I’m a software engineer with a degree in Computer Engineering and a minor in Applied Artificial Intelligence from McGill University.

I (try to) write and vibe with code, read a lot, and think even more. I’ve built a strong foundation in software engineering, automation, and machine learning through both academic research and hands-on industry experience.

I interned twice at Desjardins in Montreal, where I worked on CI pipelines, automated workflows for cybersecurity teams, and built data security solutions by implementing ETL pipelines in Kotlin. These internships gave me real-world insight into building reliable, secure systems within large organizations.

For my final year at McGill, I joined the PreFab Photonics Lab under Prof. Odile Liboiron-Ladouceur and Dr. Dusan Gostimirovic. There, I applied deep learning techniques (using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras) to optimize the manufacturing process of nanophotonic devices—a unique opportunity to merge AI with cutting-edge hardware research.

I'm fluent in English, French, and Turkish, and I thrive in multicultural, collaborative environments—having lived in Canada, Turkey, and France.

These days, I’m focused on building AI-native tools and experimenting with emerging technologies like LangGraph and LlamaIndex. I love working on projects that blend intelligent automation with great user experience.

I'm open to new opportunities and collaborations around the world. Don’t hesitate to reach out!
